# Bioinformatics-Outreach-Nigeria
Bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science, statistics, and biology to analyze and interpret biological data. As the amount of biological data generated continues to grow rapidly, there is an increasing demand for professionals with expertise in bioinformatics. To help meet this demand, we propose a university outreach program focused on developing bioinformatics capacity among University students in Nigeria and this will create early interest in genomics data analysis among the students and equip them with the relevant skills set  and knowledge in Bioinformatics.We would be working alongside other sister organizations to achieve this goal.
